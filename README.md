# study_pygame-guide
A Study Project, created by [Anirath][4] for learning about using [PyGame][1] with [Python][2] for creating games.

---

## Project Contents
The following is a list of all of the project's files and directories, and represents the file/folder structure of the [repo][3].

### Project Root
- /assets/ (All of the assets from the guide are here sorted into relevant directories. Also, other assets have been added to for the custom demos and modified defaults.)
    + ../archives/
        * ../guide-source_all-guide-assets-from-online-source.zip
    + ../fonts/
        * ../SpaceMonoFamily/ (A personal favorite font family of mine. Decided to use it in some of the demos.)
            - ../SpaceMono-Bold.ttf
            - ../SpaceMono-BoldItalic.ttf
            - ../SpaceMono-Italic.ttf
            - ../SpaceMono-Regular.ttf
    + ../img/
        * ../cat.png
- /demos/ (All of the "games" and "programs" that the guide has one create will be in here as a "demo". Every demo doesn't necessarily exactly match the source in the guide as...
          ... I have heavily altered the source code in some cases, and some of the demo's aren't even from the guide to begin with. This was to study more in my own way.)
    + ../animation.py
    + ../blank.py
    + ../drawing.py
    + ../textdrawing.py
- /docs/ (Any documents pertinent to the project and repository can be found here.)
    + ../guide-source_making-games-with-python-and-pygame_al-sweigart.pdf (The project uses this guide as a base.)
- /README.md (This document actually.)
