# study_pygame-guide
A Study Project, created by [Anirath][4] for learning about using [PyGame][1] with [Python][2] for creating games.

## Project Contents
The following is a list of all of the project's files and directories, and represents the file/folder structure of the [repo][3].

### Project Root
- /assets/[^1]
    + ../archives/
        * ../guide-source_all-guide-assets-from-online-source.zip[^2]
    + ../fonts/
        * ../SpaceMonoFamily/[^3]
            - ../SpaceMono-Bold.ttf
            - ../SpaceMono-BoldItalic.ttf
            - ../SpaceMono-Italic.ttf
            - ../SpaceMono-Regular.ttf
    + ../img/
        * ../cat.png
- /demos/[^bignote]
    + ../animation.py
    + ../blank.py
    + ../drawing.py
    + ../textdrawing.py
- /docs/ (Any documents pertinent to the project and repository can be found here.)
    + ../guide-source_making-games-with-python-and-pygame_al-sweigart.pdf (The project uses this guide as a base.)
- /README.md (This document actually.)

[^1]: All of the assets from the guide are here sorted into relevant directories. Also, other assets have been added to for the custom demos and modified defaults.
[^2]: A zip file containing all of the assets used by the [guide][5]
[^3]: My favorite monospaced font family. So, I decided to use it in some of the demo games.
[^bignote]: All of the "_games_" and "_programs_" that the [guide][5] contains will have an associated demo here. Keep in mind that some of the filenames don't match what is
given in the source, and the actual source code for some of them doesn't necessarily match either as I significantly altered and added to most of them for the sake of exploring
and researching functionality further.
